## Construction guide

### Materials required
![](https://BaDoomUK.github.io/TouchTub/Photos/01.jpg "Materials required")
1. Battery Holder with JST connecter (3 x AAA) or 3.7V LiPo battery.
2. Plastic food container
3. Sticky-backed copper tape or sheet (sheet is best)
4. Bare Conductive Touch Board (you may also need to purchase a way of reading a microSD card)
5. Micro-USB cable (for programming the Touch Board)
6. Crocodile clip cable
7. 3.5mm Audio cable
8. Wowee slim (or similar battery powered speaker)
9. Velcro dots (or a similar adhesive)

### Tools required

1. Scissors or a circle cutter (you will also need a compass if using scissors)
2. Ruler

### Stage 1 - Making a touch sensitive surface

1. Orientate your chosen tupperware tub so that it is lid-down. 
2. Measure the diameter of the top surface of the selected tub.

3. Using a circle cutter (optional) or a compass and scissors, cut a copper circle of diameter 4mm less than the total diameter.

4. Create a second copper circle with an additional rectangular copper tab.  Use the first circle you created to create a template for the second.

5. Apply the copper circle (without the tab) to the tupperware tub. Peel back a small section of the backing (as shown). Position the circle centrally on the top of the tub. Stick the peeled away section to the tub, and smooth out.

6. Apply the tabbed circle in a similar manner to the inside surface of the tub.

### Stage 2 - Securing the other components
1. Insert the 3.5mm audio cable into the Wowee speaker (or equivalant) 
2. Add four velcro dots (soft loop side) to the base of the Wowee speaker. Attach the (rough hook side) to these dots and secure the speaker to centre of the tub lid, ensuring that there is also enough room for the audio cable to sit inside the lid. 
3. Remove the audio cable.
4. Apply velcro pads to the battery holder and secure to the lid on the right hand side of the speaker.
5. Apply velcro pads to the Touch Board in the positions shown. _(This specific positioning is to allow for future soldering)_
6. The LED ring will be secured above the Wowee speaker. Using double-sided foam tape, build two towers of approximately 15mm.
7. Attach the foam tape towers to the battery pack and speaker in the positions shown. 
8. Secure the LED ring to the top of the two towers, positioned as centrally as possible.
