4. Create a second copper circle with an additional rectangular copper tab.  Use the first circle you created to create a template for the second.

5. Apply the copper circle (without the tab) to the tupperware tub. Peel back a small section of the backing (as shown). Position the circle centrally on the top of the tub. Stick the peeled away section to the tub, and smooth out.
