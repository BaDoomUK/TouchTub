### Materials required
![](https://BaDoomUK.github.io/TouchTub/Photos/01.jpg "Materials required")

1. Battery Holder with JST connecter (3 x AAA) or 3.7V LiPo battery.
2. Plastic food container
3. Sticky-backed copper tape or sheet (sheet is best)
4. Bare Conductive Touch Board (you may also need to purchase a way of reading a microSD card)
5. Micro-USB cable (for programming the Touch Board)
6. Crocodile clip cable
7. 3.5mm Audio cable
8. Wowee slim (or similar battery powered speaker)
9. Velcro dots (or a similar adhesive)

### Tools required

1. Scissors or a circle cutter (you will also need a compass if using scissors)
2. Ruler


### Stage 1 - Making a touch sensitive surface

1. Orientate your chosen tupperware tub so that it is lid-down. 
2. Measure the diameter of the top surface of the selected tub.

3. Using a circle cutter (optional) or a compass and scissors, cut a copper circle of diameter 4mm less than the total diameter.

4. Create a second copper circle with an additional rectangular copper tab.  Use the first circle you created to create a template for the second.

5. Apply the copper circle (without the tab) to the tupperware tub. Peel back a small section of the backing (as shown). Position the circle centrally on the top of the tub. Stick the peeled away section to the tub, and smooth out.

6. Apply the tabbed circle in a similar manner to the inside surface of the tub.

### Stage 2 - Securing the other components
1. Insert the 3.5mm audio cable into the Wowee speaker (or equivalent) - this is to make sure you position your audio cable fits along with the speaker. Take this opportunity to plan where your speaker, battery and touchboard will go. Make sure you leave enough room to connect a crocodile clip to the electrode side of the Touch Board (on the right side in the picture below), and that you can access any controls on your chosen speaker.

2. Add some velcro dots (soft loop side) to the base of your speaker. Attach the (rough hook side) to these dots and secure the speaker to centre of the tub lid, ensuring that there is also enough room for the audio cable to sit inside the lid.

3. Apply velcro pads to the battery holder and secure to the lid.

4. Apply velcro pads to the Touch Board in the positions shown (These positions have been chosen to allow for future soldering) and secure the Touch Board in position (we stuck ours to the speaker).

5. Connect the battery pack to the Touch Board.

6. Connect the speaker cable to the speaker.

7. You may wish to stick down the excess cable.

8. Attach the crocodile clip to one of the electrodes on the Touch Board, and connect the other clip to the copper tab on the inside of the tub.

Your tub is now physically ready!

You can test your tub at this point. Switch on your speaker and if your battery pack has a switch, turn that on too. When you finally switch on the Touch Board, a green LED should light, and when you touch the electrodes along the side of the Touch Board you should hear a tutorial playing - touch to start, touch to stop. Your touch surface should also now activate the electrode you attached it to.
